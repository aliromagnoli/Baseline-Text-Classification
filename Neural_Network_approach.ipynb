Without going into overfitting into too much detail, the more parameters you have in in your model, the higher the probability that your model will overfit (memorize the training data, causing a low training error but high validation/testing error, i.e. poor generalization to new, unseen examples). To combat this, we use regularization. More specifically, we use a method of regularization called *dropout*. Dropout works by randomly *dropping out* (setting to 0) neurons in a layer during a forward pass. The probability that each neuron is dropped out is set by a hyperparameter and each neuron with dropout applied is considered indepenently. One theory about why dropout works is that a model with parameters dropped out can be seen as a \"weaker\" (less parameters) model. The predictions from all these \"weaker\" models (one for each forward pass) get averaged together withinin the parameters of the model. Thus, your one model can be thought of as an ensemble of weaker models, none of which are over-parameterized and thus should not overfit."
